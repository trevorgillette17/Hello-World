# Hello-World
My goal here is to share what i have been learning, my experiences, and learn from others to understand how to code and
eventually get a job in the web developement field. As of now, I am brand new to coding but have enjoyed what i have learned
so far from freecodecamp.org, Flat Iron prep course, solo learn, and from different coding communities. My plan is to join a 
coding bootcamp as soon as I get the basics down. Im excited to see where this journey leads me.
